# Personal Portfolio Website

## About This Project

This is a personal portfolio website created to showcase projects and skills. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating Bootstrap for responsive design and Font Awesome for icons. The site aims to provide a clean and accessible overview of professional work and contact information.

## Features

*   Responsive design using Bootstrap.
*   Dynamic animations with AOS (Animate On Scroll).
*   Iconography from Font Awesome.
*   A simple, clean interface.

## How to Use/Setup

3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
